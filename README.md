## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid

### What I learned

The setting up of custom properties takes time for me as a beginner but it was worth it and to practice long term thinking like when some elements need to be changed and then you don't need to read every line, you just go to root and changed it whatever you like. I know this is just a simple project but it was efficient. I think my code is more readable now :D

### Useful resources

-  [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3bTwCqX4ns) - It was fun learning from Mr.Kevin of how to analyze and set your custom properties. This helped me to become more better than I was.
